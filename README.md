## INSTALLATION GUIDE
`npx @react-native-reusables/cli@latest init`

## Nine
Nine is a hybrid platform that bridges the gap between developers that build and users that use the products that developers use.
Nine is an easy-to-use platform whether you are tech-savy or not to see, discover and follow your favourite developers and use their products.

With Nine, you can get real-time alerts, not just emails about contributions to a project.
Instant notification about a project's activity when you turn on notifications for a project from Nine. Native-like notifications.
